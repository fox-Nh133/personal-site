Welcome to my personal blog!

I'm enrolled in undergraduate program at KIT, Japan. I'm interested in polymer science and fibro-science. Besides chemistry, I also have interests in informatics, especially about human machine interface. I will share about my projects, and my thoughts and ideas on this blog.
