In order to render calendar using javascript on website, FullCalendar is one of the most popular library.
FullCalendar has plugins to retrieve events from other calendar, like Google Calendar and iCalnendar feed. However, these plugins have restricted usage. In this post, I will share how I used GitHub actions to manage events from iCal feed on FullCalendar more flexbly.

# What is iCal?
iCal (as known as iCalendar) is a widely used format for calendar and scheduling programs. It is standarlized as [RFC 5545](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5455.html) by IETF. 
iCal file is a text file with `.ics` extension.
